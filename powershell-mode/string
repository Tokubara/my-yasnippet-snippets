# Strings are created with " or ' but " is required for string interpolation
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'

# Strings can be added too! But try not to do this.
"Hello " + "world!"  # => "Hello world!"

# A string can be treated like a list of characters
"Hello world!"[0]  # => 'H'

# You can find the length of a string
("This is a string").Length  # => 16

# You can also format using f-strings or formatted string literals.
$name = "Steve"
$age = 22
"He said his name is $name." 
# => "He said his name is Steve"
"{0} said he is {1} years old." -f $name, $age 
# => "Steve said he is 22 years old"
"$name's name is $($name.Length) characters long."  # 用 $() 嵌入 powershell expression, command expansion, interpolate
# => "Steve's name is 5 characters long."

# 不是用 \ 来 escape(是 path), 用 ` 来 escape
"Showing`nEscape Chars" # => new line between Showing and Escape
"Making`tTables`tWith`tTabs" # => Format things with tabs
