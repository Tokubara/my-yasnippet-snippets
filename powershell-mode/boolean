# Boolean values are primitives
$True  # => True
$False  # => False
# negate with !
!$True   # => False
!$False  # => True
# Boolean Operators
# Note "-and" and "-or" usage
$True -and $False  # => False
$False -or $True   # => True

# True and False are actually 1 and 0 but only support limited arithmetic.
# However, casting the bool to int resolves this.
$True + $True # => 2
$True * 8    # => '[System.Boolean] * [System.Int32]' is undefined
[int]$True * 8 # => 8
$False - 5   # => -5
